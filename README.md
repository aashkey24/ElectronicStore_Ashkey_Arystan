1. LOGIN CREDENTIALS (DEFAULT USERS)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The system automatically generates these users if the database is empty:

   Role           | Username  | Password
   ---------------|-----------|-----------
   Administrator  | admin     | admin123
   Manager        | manager   | manager123
   Cashier        | cashier   | cashier123

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION & ARCHITECTURE
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This application is a Desktop Management System for an Electronics Store.
It follows the Strict MVC (Model-View-Controller) Architecture:

- **Model:** Represents data objects (User, Product) and implements Serializable.
- **View:** Pure JavaFX UI classes (No FXML used, as per requirements).
- **Controller:** Handles logic, events, and communication between Model and View.
- **Util:** Helper classes for File I/O and Validation.

Data Persistence:
- Users, Products, Suppliers, and Categories are stored in binary files (.dat) using Serialization.
- Transactions (Bills) are generated as human-readable Text files (.txt).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. EXTRA FEATURES IMPLEMENTED (BONUS POINTS)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Beyond the core requirements, the following features were added:

[A] ADVANCED VALIDATION (REGEX)
    - Email addresses are validated using Regex to ensure correct format.
    - Phone numbers are validated to allow only digits and standard symbols.
    - Negative values are prevented for prices, salaries, and stock.

[B] SMART DUPLICATE PREVENTION
    - The system prevents registering users with the same Username/Email.
    - Managers cannot create duplicate Products; instead, the system triggers a "Restock" logic (updating quantity/price of existing item).
    - Suppliers and Categories are unique lists.

[C] DYNAMIC DASHBOARD UI
    - Implemented a modern "Sidebar" layout instead of basic menus.
    - Dashboard adjusts content dynamically based on the logged-in User Role.

[D] REAL-TIME FINANCIAL ANALYTICS
    - The Administrator's "Financial Overview" calculates Income by scanning and parsing actual "Bill_*.txt" files generated by Cashiers.
    - Costs are calculated based on current Employee Salaries + Total Stock Value.
    - Includes Date-Range Filtering (From/To) for specific reports.

[E] ENHANCED MANAGER TOOLS
    - Added "Manage Categories" and "Manage Suppliers" tabs.
    - Products use ComboBoxes for Category/Supplier selection (preventing typos) instead of manual text entry.
    - "Low Stock Warning" indicator on the dashboard.

[F] CASHIER HISTORY
    - Cashiers can see a "Today's History" list on their dashboard, showing all bills they generated in the current session/day.

4. HOW TO RUN
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Ensure Java (JDK) and JavaFX libraries are configured.
2. Run the main class: `com.store.main.ElectronicStoreApp`.
3. If `users.dat` does not exist, the system will create default users automatically.
